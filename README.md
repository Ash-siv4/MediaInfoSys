## Alternative Ways to Run the Application

### Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server

If you encounter CORS issues while running the application locally, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server to serve the files. Follow these steps:

1. Install Python if not already installed. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the HTTP server:

   ```
   python -m http.server
   ```

   This will start a server on port 8000 by default.

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the application.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the application logic.
- `MarathonResults.json`: JSON file containing sample marathon race results.
